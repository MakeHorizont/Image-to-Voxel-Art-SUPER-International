**Transform any image into a fully interactive 3D Voxel Art scene using the power of Google Gemini 3.**

This application uses advanced AI to analyze 2D images and "hallucinate" depth, structure, and materials to construct a 3D world in real-time using Three.js. It supports "Fly Mode" for exploration and exports to professional formats like GLB (Blender/Unity).
